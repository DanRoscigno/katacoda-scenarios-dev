Deploy the Guestbook application by running the `kubectl apply` command:

`kubectl apply -f /root/course/guestbook.yaml`{{execute}}

### Check to see if the pods are running:

`kubectl get pods`{{execute}}

If all the pods are not running, then wait a minute and run the `kubectl get pods` command again. 

### Make some entries in the Guestbook

Once the pods are all running, switch to the **Guestbook** tab and enter some messages into the Guestbook.
