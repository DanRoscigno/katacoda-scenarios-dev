`kubectl apply -f /root/course/kibana.yaml`{{execute HOST1}}

#### Verify that Kibana is running 

Check the pods for Kibana:

`kubectl get pods`{{execute HOST1}}

Check the Kibana logs:  

`kubectl logs kibana|grep "Status changed from yellow to green"`{{execute HOST1}}

Once Kibana is connected to Elasticsearch, it is ready.  Toward the end of the log file, you  will see an entry telling you that the state has gone to **green**
